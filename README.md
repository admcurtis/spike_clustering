Spike clustering using Combinato

The scipts found here convert .ns6 files containing time series for each participant sensor into a separate .mat file for each sensor per participant
Combinato can then be used to extract and cluster spikes for all participants and sensors

The final output will be a .csv with clustered spikes for each participant and sensor
